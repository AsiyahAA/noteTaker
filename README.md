# noteTaker
## Description
### Project purpose was to create an application that a user can use to write and save notes using GET/POST requests, middleware, and routes. As a bonus, a delete button was to be created so that User can delete any note they wish to delete. 
## User
### User should be able to run the server in the temrinal using node.js and once server is connected, User should be able to enter in the local host plus the path name into the searchbar to display the noteTaker html file in the borwser. User should see previous notes on the left-side of the page and can enter in new notes by pressing the plus icon or refreshing the page. User can save the note by pressing the save icon to have the note saved on the left-side of the page. User should also be able to delete an old note by pressing the trash/delete icon.
## Technologies
### GitHub was used to clone a new repository onto a computer and was also used to deploy the website when edits where finished and final version needed to be deployed. Visual Studio Code was used to create all files/clone starter code and make other code from scratch and to run commands from the integrated terminal. GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from local repository onto GitHub to update respository. Heroku was also used to deploy a final version of the application.
## Setup
### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone repository onto local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command-git clone-and copying in the URL or SSH key, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if promted. 
### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, open the new folder in VS and make new folders if there is no starter code provided (html, css, js files, etc). Starter code folders should be copied onto your own repository and express package should be installed using the terminal in VS code. Run the commands npm init i express to install express. Once all is installed, start coding and view all changes and progress made in the "Open Terminal" when you right click on the JavaScript file and use command node "file name".js to view changes.
### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to updload edits made in your local repository onto GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order for the changes to be displayed when website is deployed, as well as deploying to Heroku.

## Status 
### Unfortunetly, noteTaker app does not have full functionality. User is able to add notes and save them but is not able to click on a saved note or press the plus icon to add a new note to view it or delete an old note.
